[x] Get a link to here:
      /admin/config/security/encryption-policy
    To appear here:
      /admin/config/security
[/] If password_policy module is not enabled, /admin/config/security will not
    be available. Figure out how to handle this.
[ ] @TODO: Try using a RouteSubscriber to solve the problem described below:
    https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/dynamic-routes-drupal-8-routesubscriber

    Or route_callbacks:
    https://www.drupal.org/node/2145041
    see Devel example: \Drupal\devel_generate\Routing\DevelGenerateRoutes::routes

    Approach A:
      If password_policy is not installed, we provide the route for admin/config/security.
      If password_polich *is* installed, use RouteSubscriber to turn off ours and enable theirs.

    Approach B:
      Only provide admin/config/security via a RouteSubscriber when nobody else provides it.
      Otherwise, attach ourself to whoever provides this. (This seems better. Not sure how to do it.)
    
    Problem:
	    Rather than be dependent on password_policy, now this module provides
	    /admin/config/security. The catch is, now there are two "Security" boxes
	    at /admin/config when both modules are enabled and NEITHER module is able
	    to provide links on the other's /admin/config/security page. There must
	    be a better way. But I haven't found an equivalent to hook_menu_alter in D8
	    so far.

[ ] Hook into user login to text and reject login

[ ] Attach JavaScript to user login form
[ ] Add JavaScript-side test at login time, takeover form to prevent login if browser doesn't provide required encryption
[ ] Provide admin-defined takeover message in login block
[ ] Disable login form fields via form alter

[ ] Add /encryption-policy page with documentation of policy and info to user about their browser

[ ] Behat tests
[ ] SimpleTest tests
[ ] PHPUnit tests

[ ] Revisit @TODO notes and update with user-facing language
